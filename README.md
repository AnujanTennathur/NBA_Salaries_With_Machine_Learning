IMPORTANT NOTE: Project is in progress, more models and data will be added to this repository. Also, to view code in slide form, download and knit code.

A comprehensive look at NBA salaries and NBA Player Positions through machine learning modeling. 

NBA salaries have continued to grow at staggering rates, with teams paying individual players at rates that entire rosters used to make combined. With each passing year, more and more players benefit from rapidly increasing salaries and bonuses. 

However, an interesting question arises. What actually determines a player's salary? 

On the surface, it may just be their level of play (quantitative measures). How many points do they average? What about rebounds? etc. 

But this is not always true. While relationships certainly exist between player salary and quantitative, numeric explanatory variables, how much do they really determine a players' salary? Is it significant enough to claim that salary is dependent primarily on one's level of play? 

What is often not looked into is the "other" factors of what determines salary, such as player image, country of origin, background, social media presence, sports media coverage, etc. 

In other words, if you are the best player, does that mean you get paid the most? And if not, why? Because it's probably not your stats. 

In addition to salaries, what about predicting a specific player's position? What if you were to obtain a random player's stats, with no knowledge of what their name was, or what position they played. How would we be able to predict what position they play? 

To answer this question, I have generated classification models of different types, with various numeric and non-numeric explanatory variables, to see if we can accurately predict player position through statistical variables. Similar to salary, I will be frequently updating this database with these models. 

In this project, I aim to explore these precise concepts through various Machine Learning Modeling methods. Furthermore, I will keep updating this repository with new information about player salaries, NBA CBA salary rule changes, and other information.
