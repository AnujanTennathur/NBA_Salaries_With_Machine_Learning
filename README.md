# NBA_Salaries_With_Machine_Learning
A comprehensive look at NBA salaries through machine learning modeling. 

NBA salaries have continued to grow at staggering rates, with teams paying individual players at rates that entire rosters used to make combined. With each passing year, more and more players benefit from rapidly increasing salaries and bonuses. 

However, an interesting question arises. What actually determines a player's salary? 

On the surface, it may just be their level of play (quantitative measures). How many points do they average? What about rebounds? etc. 

But this is not always true. While relationships certainly exist between player salary and quantitative, numeric explanatory variables, how much do they really determine a players' salary? Is it significant enough to claim that salary is dependent primarily on one's level of play? 

What is often not looked into is the "other" factors of what determines salary, such as player image, country of origin, background, social media presence, sports media coverage, etc. 

In other words, if you are the best player, does that mean you get paid the most? And if not, why? Because it's probably not your stats. 

In this project, I aim to explore this precise concept through various Machine Learning Modeling methods. Furthermore, I will keep updating this repository with new information about player salaries, NBA CBA salary rule changes, and other information. 

IMPORTANT NOTE: In it's current scope, this project is looking at quantitative, nba statistics as a means of exploring relationships between performance and salary. However, I will continue to add to this project by incorporating more qualitative information into my database and models.
